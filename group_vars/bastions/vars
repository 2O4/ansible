# TODO on bastion ansible should have 2 very distinct users:
#   one to proxyjump to other servers, without sudo priviledges but allow ssh
#   one to administer the bastion, with sudo but without ssh allowed
# maybe also use 2 different SSH keys, so that if one get stolen everything is
# not compromised ?
